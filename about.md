##About Me

My name is Daric Teske, and I am a freshman computer science major. I really enjoy working with computers and
technology. I have worked with a number of programming and scripting languages including:

* Java
* C#
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JSON
* XML

I also have fairly extensive experience with the Unix operating system. I have competed in the
[IT-Olympics](http://www.it-adventures.org/it-olympics/) twice, which required massive use of
various distributions of Linux Servers.

##About My Projects

Projects. Yeah. Those. I have them. But you can't see them. Sorry, academic integrity policy and all.
Go to [this site](http://kauffman.club/~dteske/) though. Some projects that I can show are up and running, some are even 3D models in Unity!
The website isn't the prettiest, you will have to do some directory navigation. If you want to preview something, just
open the `.html` or `.php` file in the correct folder, and you will be able to test it out. Enjoy!

##About My Experience

In my sophomore year of high school, I was selected to begin work with the IT department as an intern. I worked
on various projects throughout the school year, troubleshooting and preparing classroom equipment and devices, as
well as configuring new devices and repairing hardware. Over the summer, I was asked to come in and work full-time
with the department on larger projects, such as configuring Chromebooks for the 1:1 initiative that began in 2013.
Another project that I worked on was setting up a server to handle large-scale cloning of devices over the network.
As my high school was almost completely Apple based, we used a program called [Deploy Studio](http://www.deploystudio.com)
on a Mac Server. I have also worked with Active Directory services on a Windows Server through both my high school and
the IT-Olympics that I mentioned in the About Me section.
