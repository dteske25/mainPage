##About Me

My name is Daric Teske, and I am a freshman computer science major. I really enjoy working with computers and
technology. I have worked with a number of programming and scripting languages including:

* Java
* The basics of C#
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JSON
* XML

I also have fairly extensive experience with the Unix operating system. I have competed in the
[IT-Olympics](http://www.it-adventures.org/it-olympics/) twice, which required massive use of
various distributions of Linux Servers.

##About My Experience

In January of 2015, I began work with the Jeffery S. Raikes Design Studio course as a freshman intern. I helped wherever
more work was needed, and as a result I gained real-world experience about what it was like to iterate through app
development, as well as push changes to the real world, and work with a larger team. It is a really valuable experience,
and I would highly recommend taking that opportunity if you have the chance.

In January 2012, my sophomore year of high school, I was selected to begin work with the IT department as an intern. I worked
on various projects throughout the school year, troubleshooting and preparing classroom equipment and devices, as
well as configuring new devices and repairing hardware. Over the summer, I was asked to come in and work full-time
with the department on larger projects, such as configuring Chromebooks for the 1:1 initiative that began in 2013.
Another project that I worked on was setting up a server to handle large-scale cloning of devices over the network.
As my high school was almost completely Apple based, we used a program called [Deploy Studio](http://www.deploystudio.com)
on a Mac Server. I have also worked with Active Directory services on a Windows Server through both my high school and
the IT-Olympics that I mentioned in the About Me section.
